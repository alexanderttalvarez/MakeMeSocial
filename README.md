# MakeMeSocial
## What is it?
MakeMeSocial is a small Wordpress plugin I made to be able to add your favourite Social Networks to your website.

It's prepared as a widget, so it's quite easy to use. From the "Widgets" panel you can choose among different options.

## Don't forget
That's not what you were looking for? I'm sorry, it's the first version, and it's more an excuse to try some stuff in Wodpress than a plugin you should be using.

Feel free to use it wherever you want.

## Docker-compose file
Together with the plugin, there's a file called docker-compose.yml
It allows you to use docker right away with a Wordpress installation just in case you want to test it without install Wordpress

## Known bugs
There's a small bug when editing the social networks at the administration. When deleting a social network, the "Save" button won't be available unless any input is changed. I'm working on that. The workaround is deleting a letter in the title and writing it again.
